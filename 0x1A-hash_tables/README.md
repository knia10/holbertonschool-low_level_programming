# 0x1A-hash_tables üîê
###  A Hash table is a container (Dictionary type) that allows efficient storage and retrieval of elements (called values) from other objects, called keys.


A hash table consists of an array of entries, which will be the structure that stores the information, and a hash function. The scatter function allows to associate the element stored in an entry with the key of that entry. It is therefore an important algorithm for the proper functioning of the structure.
